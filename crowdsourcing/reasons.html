    <h1>Understanding Why Authors Edit Writing</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        You will be given an original and an edited version of a phrase (typically consisting of one sentence each). It is your job to determine <strong>one or
          more</strong> reasons that the original phrase needed editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each version of the phrase, the red text indicates words that were removed, green text represents words
        that were added, and black words are words that were not changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are definitions of each category, examples of each category with an explanation, and then 6 questions to
        answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not knowing the answer is ok;
        part of this is understanding why certain categories are harder to understand than
        others.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          These phrases come from PDFs. In order to make phrases more uniform, mathematical equations such as \(a \ne
          0\) or \( \Sigma=\{\vec v=(v_1,v_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2\} \) have been replaced with [MATH].
