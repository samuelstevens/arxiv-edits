1602.08739-v2 does not have any content.

The original source has two documents. One is long and filled with commands, and the other is shorter and filled with content. Neither imports the other. 

Possible fixes:
  * some .tex preprocess (comments) before merging
  * look for \begin{document} in the file that we choose as the longest.
