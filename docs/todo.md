# To Do

1. [DONE] `CODE`: Persistently store arxivIDs and whether there are multiple versions.

2. [DONE] `PROCESS`: start scraping (P1)

3. [DONE] `CODE`: turn section text into sentences via NLTK, Stanford, some combination.

4. [DONE] `READ`: Alternative paper with matrix to align sentences

5. [DONE] `QUESTION`: How to store a `Dict[str, int]` for idf word counts?

6. [DONE] `CODE`: Tokenize text for a word count for idf.

7. `CODE`: Micro align sentences.

8. `QUESTION`: How to store all these sentence pairs? Consider network speed, storage space.

9. `CODE`: Write sentences to persistent storage.

## Problems

- Need to mimic human, slow down scraping methods.
