how to consider documents? all as one class or differentiate them into different classes?

word diff vs sentence diff vs section diff?

studying this data is valuable; that's why we can write the paper

can also move on to beyond nlp; why do people upload new versions of papers, when, etc.

we need to figure out how to approach sentence alignment; should we use section alignment, paragraph alignment, etc; should we use a uniform aligner, or some sort of filter beforehand; 

need explanations of analysises (might be 5 different analysises)

spend a full day thinking about different analysises; think about an optimal order (order for time) (include estimation of time) -> no more than 2 weeks (can take a lot of time)
