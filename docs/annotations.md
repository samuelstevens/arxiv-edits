- Can't align it, the math is too much.
- I really think a large part of it was rewritten
- I can't tell what's the same and what's different because so much of it is held behind [MATH] tags.
- I actually think this one has too much math to be useful.

1306.1389-v1	1306.1389-v2:	41.1%

- This paper has show me that % changed is not as important as # of [MATH] tags and total # of modifications.
