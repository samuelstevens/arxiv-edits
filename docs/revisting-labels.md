`On the other hand, for much` higher values of `[MATH],` the `information about` the `empty slit is lost faster than` the interference `damping takes place,` and `some` trajectories `can` cross the `symmetry` axis `of` the `experiment`.

`However, as we move to` higher values of `[MATH] (from left to right in` the `figure),` the `screening starts to increase in importance over` the interference `quenching` and trajectories `start to` cross the axis `between` the `two slits`.

In order to elucidate and understand how decoherence causes this interference quenching, we have considered here the simple trajectory based models mentioned above.

In order to elucidate and understand decoherence without taking into account explicitly the dynamics of the environment degrees of freedom, we have considered some simple reduced quantum-trajectory models.

Since the black hole universe can be regarded as a globally flat universe model by its construction, we compare the expansion rate of the black hole universe with that in the Einstein-deSitter(EdS) universe.

Since the coarse-grained black hole universe can be regarded as a homogeneous and isotropic universe model with vanishing spatial curvature by its construction, we compare the expansion rate of the black hole universe with that in the Einstein-de Sitter(EdS) universe.

As is discussed in Ref. [CITATION], we expect that the deviation from the EdS universe becomes smaller as the universe expands.

As was discussed in Ref. [CITATION], it is expected that the deviation of the black hole universe from the EdS one becomes the smaller, the larger [MATH] becomes, or in other words, the effects of local inhomogeneities on the global expansion law is negligible if [MATH] is sufficiently large.
